                    Greetings in Peace!! I am pleased to inform everyone that
                    the Royal government of Cambodia, through the Ministry of
                    Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) has obtained a loan
                    from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance the
                    implementation of the Uplands Irrigation and Water Resources
                    Management Sector Project (UIWRMSP). This project
                    complements our government’s strategy to enhance economic
                    growth through the rehabilitation and development of
                    approximately 29,500 hectares of existing irrigation schemes
                    within the provinces of Kampong Thom and Battambang.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-justify">
                    Focusing on its major outputs, the UIWRMSP aims to achieve
                    enhanced efficiency and climate resilience of irrigation
                    systems through rehabilitation, modernization and
                    climate-proofing of at least three irrigation systems in the
                    project sites. More importantly, the project intends to
                    build a strong and functional Farmer Water-Users Communities
                    who will take the lead role in the operations and
                    maintenance of these irrigation systems.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-justify">
                    It is also important to note that the Cambodian Agricultural
                    Sector is one of the biggest contributors in the country’s
                    economy particularly in rice production. Hence, the UIWRMSP
                    is a good strategy for us to alleviate farmers from poverty
                    through increased agricultural production and profitability
                    as the project strengthens their capacities in managing
                    resources to support other economic needs through livelihood
                    and food for work projects.

                  It is our pride that we have received this unprecedented
                  opportunity to improve our economy especially in agricultural
                  production. MOWRAM as the executing agency of this project
                  recognizes the importance of partnership with various
                  stakeholdersto realize the project goals. It is in this spirit
                  that we encourage all line Ministries and other concerned
                  sectors to join and support us in realizing a better society
                  for our countrymen.
